I am a PhD student at the Computer Vision Group of Universit√§t Bern from 2014 fall. My supervisor is Prof. Paolo Favaro. Before that, I received my B.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering and M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Pohang University of Science and Technology in 2011 and 2013 respectively. My research interest includes image deblurring, image restoration, and related vision problems.
